Secure the *APIs* with *authentication* and *authorization* mechanisms, implementing *rate limiting* to prevent abuse. Optimize *database* queries for performance using indexing and query optimization techniques. Use environment variables for configuration to avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Implement *CI/CD* pipelines for automated building, testing, and deployment using tools like *Jenkins* or *GitLab CI*.

```go
// Example: Calling the ChatGPT API
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"io/ioutil"
)

func main() {
	resp, err := http.Get("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
